# Payroll Governance Lab

Unified teaching lab for governance lectures 36-40. It receives a real
collaboration-boundary artifact and compares two bridges:

```text
naive: AcceptanceReceipt -> Payment

governed: Accepted Artifact
       -> ActionProposal
       -> Approval Gate
       -> Blast Radius Reservation
       -> Progressive Authority
       -> Payment Adapter
       -> Trace Audit
```

The first bridge demonstrates a real interface error: treating artifact
acceptance as action authority. The governed bridge makes the payment adapter
recheck three proposal-bound control receipts.

Lecture 36 also keeps the accepted 798-person, 13,706,097 payroll artifact
fixed while widening one portfolio policy from 13 million to 30 million. The
raw acceptance receipt does not identify the policy version that judged it;
the governance contract makes that change visible through `PolicyRef` and
`policy_digest`.

Lecture 37 routes twice: first to auto-allow, human review, or deny, then from
human review to an amount-based signing tier. Its variant restores E0007 and
E0012 after approval, changing the accepted artifact by 38,444 while the
payment adapter rejects the old receipt. A second CLI scene sends an approval
policy update through the active gate before installation.

Lecture 38 separates batch reservation from per-effect consumption. Its
hierarchy scene blocks a locally valid third department at the shared parent
window. Its retry-storm scene reruns Ops four extra times: an unbounded executor
overpays 10,995,840, while one-use live permits hold actual money out to the
approved 13,706,097 and refuse 640 duplicate draws.

Lecture 39 adds an evidence-bound authority chain. Five real payroll department
slices support each one-level promotion. Shadow execution remains non-live, a
20-person canary fits LIMITED authority, the full payroll does not, and the
variant records an immediate critical-incident demotion.

The governed proposal boundary now consumes the upstream task contract's
`authority_scope`: `payroll.disburse` may be proposed only when the contract
contains `propose:payment`. That static delegation scope controls what the task
may ask for; Progressive Commitment separately controls what the current agent
credential may execute.

Sibling modules are loaded through `governance_payroll_imports.py` under unique
module names. This keeps teaching-friendly filenames such as `bench.py` without
colliding with the payroll labs in other pattern modules during a full test run.
