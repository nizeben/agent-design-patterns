"""Lecture 38 hands-on: how much can one bug spend before anything stops it?

Three scenes on the month-end payroll world, no API key, no database
damage (payments are simulated in memory). Every import here is
committed code; the b-blast-radius pattern industrializes what scene 2
sketches.

    scene 1  the unbounded rerun: the CFO ticket from lecture 37
             approved 13,706,097. Then a retry bug re-executes the Ops
             batch four extra times. Every admission gate this course
             shipped -- the 3,000,000 batch line, the 13,000,000 cash
             line, the funding cap, the approval ticket -- stays green,
             because every one of them reads CLAIMED amounts before
             execution. Actual money out: 24,701,937. The blast radius
             of one bug is the whole ledger.
    scene 2  the envelope tree: the approved amount becomes the root
             BudgetEnvelope; each department reserves a child envelope
             (amount, payment count, allowed employee ids). A child can
             only narrow its parent. Execution draws from the envelope
             BEFORE money moves. The same retry bug now dies on its
             first extra draw: paid stays 13,706,097, and the damage
             shows up as refusals naming the envelope, not as money.
    scene 3  the three axes: amount, count, and object scope refuse
             independently. A sixth 5,000,000 "retro" reservation dies
             at reserve time because the root is fully partitioned --
             the sum-blind gap from lecture 32 becomes structurally
             impossible. A contractor outside the root roster cannot
             even be reserved for; a Sales employee cannot be paid
             through the Ops envelope.

Totals are computed from the bench ledger, not typed in. The envelope
book is a teaching minimum: no persistence, no concurrent draws, no
release/return of unused reservation, no exclusive-partition check
between siblings. Those belong to the pattern, not the intro lab.

Run `python3 budget_envelope_lab.py` from the repo root.
