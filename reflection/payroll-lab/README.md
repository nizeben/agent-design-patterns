# payroll-lab — hands-on bench for the Reflection module

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Continues the payroll bench from [`../../action/payroll-lab/`](../../action/payroll-lab/):
same SQLite database, now at month-end — 798 payslips PAID, 2 REVERSED
(the saga rollback from the Action module). The agent wrote a monthly
report claiming 800 paid, 0 reversed. The Reflection module's question:
how does it find out the report is wrong?

```bash
python3 self_grade_lab.py            # introspection vs. one external signal
python3 self_grade_lab.py --strict   # a harsher self-critic changes the score, not the findings
```

The introspective critic approves the wrong report twice (it can check
consistency, not truth). Two SQL counts against the ledger reject it
immediately. That contrast is the module's spine: reflection needs an
external signal to close the loop.
