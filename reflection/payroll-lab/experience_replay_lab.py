"""Lecture 29 hands-on: June's fall becomes July's background.

Uses the pattern from ../c-experience-replay/pattern.py on the payroll
bench. June's settlement ended with a saga rollback (E0007/E0012
REVERSED, lecture 22); the L1 lesson distilled from that trace says:
verify an employee's CURRENT department against the HR record before
binding them into a department batch. Three scenes:

    scene 1  recall changes the decision: July's batch build runs twice,
             once bare (a transferred employee lands in the old
             department's batch, totals balance, nobody notices) and
             once inside the recalled context layer (membership check
             applied, the employee is re-routed)
    scene 2  the external signal at work: six months of reuse outcomes
             flow back; the superstitious lesson ("June worked because
             we exported the report twice first") sinks below the
             health line and is archived, while the membership lesson
             builds the track record that qualifies it to graduate
             into a pre-action guard
    scene 3  run with --no-feedback: nobody writes reuse outcomes back;
             in month 7 the superstitious lesson is still being
             injected, and the real lesson still has no track record

Run `python3 experience_replay_lab.py` (add --no-feedback for scene 3).
