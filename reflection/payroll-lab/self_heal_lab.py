"""Lecture 30 hands-on: the payout script goes red, the agent heals it.

Uses the pattern from ../d-self-heal-loop/pattern.py on the payroll
bench. July's payout script fails its reconciliation tests in CI; the
healer diagnoses, patches, re-runs -- bounded by the triple stop
(3 rounds hard cap, critic gate on every patch, regression check +
full rollback). Three scenes:

    scene 1  convergence: two real defects surface one after the other
             (REVERSED payslips included in the payout, then a stale
             department binding); two rounds, two atomic commits,
             green. The recurring failure class is then proposed as a
             regression-test guard (lecture 25) so next month the same
             red light never turns on.
    scene 2  test cheating: the patch raises the expected total in the
             test instead of fixing the code; the critic checkpoint
             blocks it before apply and hands the case to a human.
    scene 3  run with --meltdown: the same symptom-chasing fixer, first
             in a naive unbounded loop (the main-branch incident in
             miniature: nine overlapping edits, no atomic commits,
             nothing to roll back to), then under the triple stop
             (regression detected in round 1, full rollback, clean).

Run `python3 self_heal_lab.py` (add --meltdown for scene 3).
