"""Lecture 28 hands-on: June's settlement workflow becomes a routable skill.

Uses the pattern from ../b-skill-package/pattern.py on the payroll bench.
June's social-base settlement took three critic rounds to get right
(lecture 27); this lab freezes that workflow into a skill for July.
Three scenes:

    scene 1  verify before store: the distilled skill froze the OLD policy
             year into its steps; two golden questions fail, it stays
             TRIAL; fix one step, re-verify, promoted to VERIFIED
    scene 2  the router only sees VERIFIED: July's task routes to the
             promoted skill; a trigger-matching TRIAL skill is invisible;
             an unmatched task falls back to from-scratch, explicitly
    scene 3  run with --no-gate: the wrong-year skill is stored as
             trusted without verification, July routes to it, and the
             800-person fixture shows how many contribution-base results
             would be wrong -- silently, every step reporting success

Run `python3 skill_package_lab.py` (add --no-gate for scene 3).
